After recently losing my personal infrastructure to theft, I decided to relocate
my personal website to a VPS to reduce complexity and prevent the possiblilty of
another loss. This site is powered by the Hugo static website engine and uses my
own fork of the excellent [HugoMDL](https://github.com/jchatkinson/HugoMDL)
theme by Jeremy Atkinson.

The purpose of this site is to provide me with a place to record thoughts and
observations that I have over the course of my work, education and hobbies. By
placing these thoughts on the internet, perhaps they will be useful to myself or
somebody else in the future.
